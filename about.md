I'm Joshua Austill.  I am a full stack developer that is certified in MongoDB and C#.  However, I spend most of my time currently
writing in nodejs and knockoutjs.  I don't normally have a ton to say, but once in awhile I feel like writing something down.

Github uses Jenkyll for these personal pages, and I am not a ruby developer, so this site will probably start out rather plain.
